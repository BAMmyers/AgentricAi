It is strongly recommended that you consult with a qualified legal professional to choose or draft a license that accurately and legally reflects your desired terms and provides appropriate protection for your intellectual property under your specific jurisdiction. The Apache 2.0 License, while a popular open-source license, may not align with all the restrictions outlined above, particularly concerning commercial use and modification for commercial purposes.

**Note on Apache 2.0 (for reference, if considered):**
The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive free software license. It allows users to:
- Freely use, modify, and distribute the software in source or binary form.
- Sublicense the software.
- Use the software for commercial purposes.
It requires preservation of copyright and license notices and provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users. If you intend to strictly limit commercial use and modifications by third parties for commercial purposes, the Apache 2.0 license by itself would not achieve this. You would need a different license or a custom agreement.
