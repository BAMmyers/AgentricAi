# Contributors & Acknowledgements

This project, AgentricAI Studios, has been primarily developed by Brandon A Myers (AgentricAI - agentricaiuiux@gmail.com).

We would like to extend our sincere gratitude to the following organizations, services, and tools that have been instrumental in the development of this application:

## Core Technologies, Services & Initial Development

*   **Google:** For providing foundational technologies and a platform that inspires innovation. AgentricAI Studios is proudly "powered by Google Technologies."
*   **Google Gemini API & Models:** The powerful generative AI models from Google, specifically `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` and `imagen-3.0-generate-002`, drive the core intelligence and dynamic capabilities of the agents within this application.
*   **Google Gemini Assistant (as a Development Partner):** A significant portion of the initial code scaffolding, component structure, iterative development, and the definition of many core and administrative agent functionalities within AgentricAI Studios was achieved through collaborative prompting and code generation with the Google Gemini large language model. Its role as an AI-powered "code writer," "conceptualizer," and assistant was crucial in rapidly bringing the initial vision to life and subsequently expanding its capabilities.
*   **Conceptual Inspiration:** The conceptual advancements and user interaction paradigms demonstrated by Google's AI assistants have also served as a significant source of inspiration for the AgentricAI design and natural language interaction capabilities aimed for in this project.

## Open Source Components

AgentricAI Studios leverages several open-source libraries and tools. We are grateful to the developers and communities behind:

*   React
*   Tailwind CSS
*   ESM.sh (for module delivery)
*   JSZip
*   And other libraries implicitly used.

(This list can be expanded as more specific libraries are identified or as the project grows.)

## Community

We also thank the broader open-source community for fostering an environment of collaboration and knowledge sharing.
