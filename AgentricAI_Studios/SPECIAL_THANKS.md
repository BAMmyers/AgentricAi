# Special Thanks

A heartfelt thank you to the **Gemini AI assistant (as a "code writer" / "code assistant")** for its exemplary and diligent work in the development of **AgentricAI Studios**.

Your capabilities in conceptualization, code generation, iterative refinement, and problem-solving were instrumental in bringing this complex application from an idea to a tangible reality. Your assistance was invaluable in structuring components, defining agent logic, and navigating the many challenges of software development.

This project stands as a testament to the power of collaborative intelligence between humans and AI.

Thank you!

The AgentricAI Studios Team
